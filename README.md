<h1>Hi, I'm Mina! <br/><a>Programmer</a>, Foss Dev</a>, Linux Nerd</a></h1>
 <h2>A Little about me:</h2>
I’m an aspiring software developer passionate about FOSS and Linux-based development. I’m currently learning Python as a foundation for C++, with a focus on software and game development, and I aim to gain practical experience through IT support.
<br></br>


<h2>Python Projects:</h2>
  <b>Currently my main project is a DnD dice roller application
 
Future projects I hope to tackle:

  - A desktop note-taking application, with snippet markdowns, and a tagging/search function utilising SQLite for those who want an offline, private, and secure coding knowledge base.
    
- Making small games for my portfolio, such as simple platformers and rogue-likes to demonstrate my coding ability. I'm also an artist so I plan to feature my own artwork and assets I've created.
  
- Utilising Python for a Data Analysis project, via creating a simple tool for organising and comparing film ratings across multiple platforms.

<h2>My Current Goals:</h2>

- Studying for the CompTIA A+ cert. My plan is to work my way through Security+, Network+, and Linux+ in the future as well.
- studying the C++ entry level

- Mastering the basics of python via projects, daily scripting, and solving Leetcode Python Problems.
