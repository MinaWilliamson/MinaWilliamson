  <b>Py-Fun is my personal project where I create weird things no one needs for my own entertainment and learning!</b> 


<h2>My Goals:</h2>

- Applying Python to real world development scenarios, and seeing how to practically impliment it to achive ideas I have.
- Studying for the CompTIA A+ cert. My plan is to work my way through Security+, Network+, and Linux+ in the future as well.
- Working on a desktop note-taking application, with snippet markdowns, and a tagging/search function utilising SQLite for those who want an offline, private, and secure coding knowledge base.

  <h2>A Little about me:</h2>
I always grew up surrounded by computers. My mother was a data scientist and programmer who was fascinated by VPNs, torrenting, and scripting as I was growing up. My dad was an avid jerry-rigging PC builder, who spent much of his free time bashing scrap Intel CPUs into screaming Lenovo boards. He loved linux, always christening the freaks of nature he created with spare Ubuntu and Redhat installs he got off old disks from PC magazine. My first computer was my beloved Raspberry Pi model B when I was just 9 years old. I spent many hours trying to unnsuccessfully program a chat bot (similar to clever bot, which I adored at the time) and trying to play Minecraft education ed. to no luck.
