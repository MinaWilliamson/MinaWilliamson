<h1>Hi, I'm Mina! <br/><a>Programming -</a> Data Analytics</a> - </a>Data Visualization</h1>
 <h2>About me</h2>
 
I have a background in administration, and I am currently trying to transition into the Programming and data science industry. I have developed a strong foundation in administrative skills and GDPR compliant data handling as a ward based receptionist and admin. 

During my last role, I honed my ability for qualitative data entry and developed a keen eye for identifying discrepancies in data. I also gained experience in conducting surveys and audits, helping give useful insight to management on day to day ward operations and patient satisfaction.

In my free time, I enjoy exploring Python and data simulations, and I am always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. I am also a passionate artist and designer, and enjoy making pretty, clear, and user-accessible data visualisations in Power BI and Metabase. Whether working in a team or independently, I am driven by the excitement of learning, and the satisfaction of using logic and data to solve complex problems.
