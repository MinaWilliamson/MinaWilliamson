<h1>Hi, I'm Mina! <br/><a>Programmer</a>, Foss Dev</a>, Linux Nerd</a></h1>

<h2>Python Projects:</h2>

  <b>Py-Fun is my personal project where I create weird things no one needs for my own entertainment and learning!</b> 


<h2>My Current Goals:</h2>

- Applying Python to real world development scenarios, and seeing how to practically implement coding to achieve ideas I have.
- Studying for the CompTIA A+ cert. My plan is to work my way through Security+, Network+, and Linux+ in the future as well.
- Working on a desktop note-taking application, with snippet markdowns, and a tagging/search function utilising SQLite for those who want an offline, private, and secure coding knowledge base.
- Making small games for my portfolio, such as simple platformers and rogue-likes to demonstrate my coding ability. I'm also an artist so I plan to feature my own artwork and assets I've created.
- Utilising Python for a Data Analysis project, via creating a simple tool for organising and comparing film ratings across multiple platforms.

 <h2>A Little about me:</h2>
I'm an aspiring Python and C++ developer with a great deal of interest in FOSS and Linux based development. At the moment I am currently cutting my teeth into programming via Python, and from there plan to learn the fundamentals of C++. I'm interested primarily in working in software and Game Development, but plan to hone my craft while working IT Help Desk after getting the A+ cert.
