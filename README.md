<h1>Hi, I'm Mina! <br/><a>Programmer</a>, Foss Dev</a>, Linux Nerd</a></h1>
 <h2>A Little about me:</h2>
I'm an aspiring Python and C++ developer with a great deal of interest in FOSS and Linux based development. At the moment I am currently cutting my teeth into programming via Python, and from there plan to learn the fundamentals of C++. I'm interested primarily in working in software and Game Development, but plan to hone my craft while working IT Help Desk after getting the A+ cert.

<h2>Python Projects:</h2>
  <b>Currently I have a single responsitory where I store all my Python Projects. https://github.com/MinaWilliamson/python-portfolio</b>
 
  Here you can find one off scripts as well as my current larger projects:

  - Working on a desktop note-taking application, with snippet markdowns, and a tagging/search function utilising SQLite for those who want an offline, private, and secure coding knowledge base.
    
- Making small games for my portfolio, such as simple platformers and rogue-likes to demonstrate my coding ability. I'm also an artist so I plan to feature my own artwork and assets I've created.
  
- Utilising Python for a Data Analysis project, via creating a simple tool for organising and comparing film ratings across multiple platforms.

<h2>My Current Goals:</h2>

- Studying for the CompTIA A+ cert. My plan is to work my way through Security+, Network+, and Linux+ in the future as well.

- Mastering the basics of python via projects, daily scripting, and solving Leetcode Python Problems.

- Applying what I have learnt from both my certifications and Python to ease my transition into learning and mastering C++
